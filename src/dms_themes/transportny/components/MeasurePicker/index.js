/**
 * NPMRDS "Measure" picker — sectionMenu item-group builder.
 *
 * Registered for the "AVL Graph" component via theme.sectionMenuExtensions
 * (see theme.js / themev2.js) and the generic dms-side extension point in
 * sectionMenu.jsx / sectionMenuExtensions.js. Only offered when the page has
 * a ReportRouteList sibling section (isReportPage below) — this is a
 * report-building tool, not a generic AVL Graph feature. Lets an author pick
 * Graph Type + Measure + Resolution + Comparison Mode and generates the
 * underlying columns/join/comparisonSeries(.combine + the $self-bound
 * ReportRouteList subscriber)/display config live, writing through
 * dwAPI.setState the same way the built-in join/comparisonSeries/pivot menus
 * do — the result stays editable afterward via those same generic controls
 * (author-empowerment principle, root CLAUDE.md). The goal is that applying
 * a pick leaves the graph exactly as report-ready as the Report Page
 * template's own pre-wired starter graph — immediately assignable via
 * ReportRouteList, not just "has the right columns."
 *
 * v1 is a "smart default generator": every apply fully re-composes and
 * overwrites the fields it owns (columns/join/comparisonSeries.combine/
 * display.colors) rather than tracking drift against a saved spec — see the
 * task file's "Workstream 2" section for the design record.
