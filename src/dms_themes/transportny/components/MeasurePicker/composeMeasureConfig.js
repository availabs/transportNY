/**
 * NPMRDS "Measure" picker — composition layer.
 *
 * Reads the shared, plain-data vocabulary (./vocabulary.json — see the sibling
 * README.md for the field reference and the Python-side consumer) and composes
 * a live Graph/AVL Graph section's
 * `columns`/`join`/`comparisonSeries.combine`/`display` color config from an
 * author's Graph Type + Measure + Resolution + Comparison Mode picks.
 *
 * This mirrors scripts/npmrds-reports/convert_old_reports.py's TEMPLATE_SPECS +
 * ensure_graph_templates composition (same ingredients, same shapes) but has
 * no base template to clone from — every field this picker cares about is
 * built from scratch here. See

//    view exists but is missing every speed_pctl_* column — see vocab.py's own note).

//    Weekend) — a graph whose "When" window doesn't land unambiguously on one of those four
//    (a custom window, "All Day", or a mixed weekday+weekend mask) has no real bin to read, and

/**
 * Compose the full section-state patch for a Table with N measures — one yAxis-target column
 * per measure, sharing a single xAxis (resolution) column and a single, unioned `join`. Table has
 * no comparison-mode/anchor/color/legend/tooltip concept (Spreadsheet ignores all of those —
 * confirmed by reading `ComponentRegistry/spreadsheet/index.jsx`'s own column selection, which
 * filters purely on `show`/`selectOnly`, never `target` or anything display-shaped), so this is
 * deliberately much smaller than `composeMeasureConfig` above rather than a Table-flavored branch
 * bolted onto it.
 *
 * The one piece that genuinely needs merge logic across measures: `join`. A table's `state.join`
 * is ONE shared structure, not per-column, so combining e.g. `speed` (needs only META_JOIN) with
 * `hoursOfDelay` (needs META_JOIN + AADT_DIST_JOIN) must union+dedupe both measures' own
 * `requiresJoin` lists — using only the last-composed measure's join would silently drop a table
 * whose OTHER columns' SQL expressions reference a join that was never applied. Whether that
 * union ends up non-empty ALSO decides which of a zero-join measure's two expression forms is
 * safe (see `QUALIFIED_EXPR_WHEN_TABLE_HAS_JOIN` above) — so the join is resolved once, up front,
 * and both the column-building and the returned `join` itself read from that one value.
 *
 * `routeCompare` (optional, default false) appends a `buildRouteCompareDeltaColumn` right after
 * each measure's own value column — deliberately not a template-level concept (nothing else about
 * a Route Compare table differs from an ordinary Summary table), just an extra column an author
 * can turn on for any Table.
 *
 * `routeCompare` only ever takes effect at `resolutionKey === 'summary'` — found live 2026-08-21:
 * `__ANCHOR__(<expr>)` (dms-server's `substituteAnchorMarkers`) substitutes to a scalar subquery
 * over the anchor arm's ENTIRE row set, with no GROUP BY of its own, regardless of what the outer
 * query groups by. At Summary resolution that's correct — every row is already one whole-range
 * aggregate per route, so the delta is a genuine route-vs-route comparison, exactly what the old
 * Route Compare Component always was (`ensure_route_compare_template` never time-buckets). At any
 * time-bucketed resolution (Hour/Day/Weekday/Month), the outer query groups per bucket while the
 * anchor subquery still collapses the whole range, so the delta becomes "this bucket vs the
 * anchor's OVERALL average" — on a single-route table that degenerates into "this hour vs this
 * same route's own average," which is not a route comparison at all. Silently ignored rather than
 * gated with an error, matching `isUnsupportedSummaryMeasure`'s own "nothing to apply" precedent
 * just above.
 *
 * `includeReliability` (optional, default false) appends LOTTR/TTTR/Freeflow columns from source
 * 1410's year-matched pgFederated join (`composeReliabilityColumns` above) — same "silently
 * ignored when it can't apply cleanly" contract as `routeCompare`, gated the same way (Summary
 * resolution only — 1410's PM3 data has no time-of-day dimension beyond its own 4 precomputed
 * bins, so a hurly/daily/monthly bucket would just repeat the identical value in every row) PLUS
 * only when the graph's own routes/window/year actually resolve a real bin+view
 * (`resolveReliabilityBin`/`resolveReliabilityYear`). `routeIds`/`routeWindows`/`allRoutes` are
 * only needed when `includeReliability` is set — every existing caller that never uses this flag
 * is unaffected by their absence. A Table may have reliability ON with zero other measures picked
 * (Info Box's own real shape had no "other measure" concept at all), so the early-return below no
 * longer requires `measures.length` alone.
 *
 * Returns null if no measureKey in `measureKeys` is recognized AND reliability doesn't apply
 * either (mirrors composeMeasureConfig's own "unknown measure -> nothing to apply" contract).
