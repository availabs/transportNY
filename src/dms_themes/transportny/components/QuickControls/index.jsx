/**
 * NPMRDS "Quick Controls" — sectionHeaderExtensions builder for "AVL Graph"/"Spreadsheet"/"Map".
 *
 * Design push #2 (2026-08-06): grows from 2 pills (Measure, Comparison Mode) to 5 (Routes,
 * Measure, When, Aggregate, Mode) — the exact facets that moved OFF the route (weekday mask,
 * time-of-day, route assignment) now live here, on the graph's own `display._measurePick`
 * (see MeasurePicker/composeMeasureConfig.js's DEFAULT_PICK and useGraphPublish.js's per-graph
 * transformReportRoutes, which reads these same fields back out). Every pill still writes
 * through the shared `applyMeasurePick` so this row and the older Settings-drawer item-group
 * (MeasurePicker/index.js) can never silently drift.
 *
 * report-authoring-ux-overhaul.md Tier 5 (2026-08-20): added a left-aligned "layout" group —
 * Move Up/Down buttons (via `actions.moveItem`, the same array-splice `sectionArray.jsx` already
 * exposes in its own Settings-drawer toolbar) plus a Width pill (reads/writes the section's own
 * `size` attribute — same field/mechanism as sectionMenu.jsx's Settings-drawer Width control) —
 * pinned to this row's own left edge, deliberately separate from the right-aligned DATA pill
 * cluster below (routes/measure/when/aggregate/mode). Both simply expose an already-working,
 * already-persisting capability one click closer, matching every other pill in this row.
 *
 * Two design decisions kept from the mockup (npmrds-report.js:929-1073):
 *   1. WHEN IS ONE PILL, not two — time-of-day and day-of-week are one thought ("weekday PM
 *      peak"), splitting them would double the pill count for no gain.
 *   2. THE ROW COMPRESSES. Not every card is wide enough for every DATA pill — below a certain
 *      width the row measures itself and folds the lowest-priority pills into one "⋯" pill that
 *      opens the same popover contents, in this drop order: mode → aggregate → when → measure.
 *      Routes never drops — it's the reason this row exists. The left-aligned layout group
 *      (Move Up/Down, Width) is outside this whole mechanism entirely — see the row's own JSX
 *      comment.
 *
 * 2026-08-19 (report-authoring-ux-overhaul.md item 4): this row now mounts and stays interactive
 * for the whole time a PAGE is open at /edit/... — no longer gated on this section's own
 * SectionEdit pencil being clicked first (see QuickControlsRow's `editPageMode` check). Picks
 * persist via `actions.updateAttribute`, the same channel drag-reorder already uses under
 * SectionView, not `dwAPI.setState` alone (dead for persistence there).
