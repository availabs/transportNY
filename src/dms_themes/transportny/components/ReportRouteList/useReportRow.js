  // page, not an error.
  //
  // Two things are required to get the row's own `id` back — both silently missing
  // before this fix, and together the actual root cause of routes/graphIds never
  // surviving a refresh:
  // 1. `id` isn't one of `externalSource.columns` (those are just the `data` JSONB
  //    keys) — it must be pushed as its own `systemCol` column, mirroring the
  //    convention `getData.js` uses for every other editable dataset row (Card/
  //    Spreadsheet). `sort: 'desc'` also makes a real read deterministic (prefer the
  //    newest row) if duplicate rows exist from before this fix.
  // 2. `createRequest.js`'s `uda` case reads its actual SELECT attribute list from
  //    `wrapperConfig.filter.attributes` — NOT from anything embedded in
  //    `udaConfig.options`. Omitting it (as this code did) makes the request fall
  //    back to fetching bare `data` only, so `id` (and any other explicitly-added
  //    column) never reaches the response regardless of what's in `options`. Must
  //    pass `udaConfig.attributes` (the same `columnsToFetch.map(c => c.reqName)`
  //    list `getData.js` sends) explicitly.
  // 3. Once `attributes` is a real list (rather than the `['data']` fallback), each
  //    fetched value comes back keyed by its own full SQL expression string (e.g.
  //    `"id as id"`, `"data->>'routes' as routes"`), not by a clean alias — `getData.js`
  //    (`getData.js:557-559`) remaps `row[column.reqName]` into `row[column.name]`
  //    after every fetch for exactly this reason. `row.id`/`row.routes` must go
  //    through the same remap or they're reading a key that was never set.
  // Without all three, `row.id` was always `undefined` on every read — `persistRoutes`
  // could never find an existing row to update and fell back to inserting a new one
  // on every single edit.
  //
  // `forItemId` is the page id this specific call was issued for, captured by the
  // effect below at the moment `item.id` changed — never re-read from the `item`
  // closure once the async fetch is in flight. Two different report pages share
  // this ONE mounted component instance (every report's `/edit/...` route matches
  // the same wildcard React Router route, so switching reports never remounts
  // `ReportRouteList` — only `item` changes, one render after the URL does, via
  // EditWrapper's own effect). Without `forItemId`, a page switch mid-fetch left
  // `reportRow`/`reportRowIdRef` holding the PREVIOUS report's row while `item.id`
  // already pointed at the new one — and a since-deleted orphan-cleanup effect
  // (removed by Design Push #2, 2026-08-06; it used to strip any route's
  // `graphIds` not found in the CURRENT page's own sections) would then see the
  // old report's routes against the new report's section ids, find every graphId
  // "orphaned," and auto-persist the wipe under the new report's `report_id` using
  // the old row's id — corrupting a second page with zero user interaction.
  // Confirmed live 2026-07-21 (see reportroutelist-graphids-wiped-on-refresh.md's
  // follow-up). The `forItemId` check after the await re-verifies this load is
  // still the current one before committing anything, so a slow, now-superseded

  // stale `routes` closure and drop all but the last write). Callers are responsible for
  // excluding derived-date routes and the copy source from `routeIndexes` — this function just
  // applies the span uniformly to whatever indexes it's given.
  //
  // Design push #2 (2026-08-06): shrunk to date-span only — weekday mask moved off the route
  // entirely (see useGraphPublish.js/QuickControls), so there's nothing else left to paste.
