// A Dynamic Report's persisted `routes` (from useReportRow) are SLOT PLACEHOLDERS — each carries
// a stable route_comp_id/color (assigned once, at authoring time, via the same addRoutes flow a
// normal report uses) but no concrete tmc_array/dates. This hook
// resolves those slots against the REAL route ids supplied via the page's `routeSlots`-typed URL
// param, at VIEW TIME ONLY — never persisted, a pure in-memory overlay recomputed on every
// navigation.
//
// Grouped, not raw-positional (2026-08-03): a slot may carry `route_slot_group` when several slot
// ROWS represent different date/settings VIEWS of the same one real route the viewer picks once —
// the old tool's own "1 route, N time windows" shape (e.g. template 244 "Year Over Year": 11 date-
// range comps, all one conceptual route). `routeIds[j]` fills every slot whose group is the j-th
// DISTINCT group value, in first-appearance order among `slots`. A slot with no `route_slot_group`
// falls back to grouping by its own `route_comp_id` (always unique per slot), which reproduces the
// original positional behavior byte-for-byte for every already-shipped single-view Dynamic Report —
// this is a pure extension, not a behavior change, for anything that predates this field.
//
// `id`-filtering against the catalog works because fetchCatalogRows.js already declares `id` as a
// systemCol column on every call — buildUdaConfig.js's attributeAccessorStr returns the bare
// column name (not a `data->>` accessor) for a systemCol, and mapFilterGroupCols resolves a filter
// leaf's `col` against exactly that columns list — confirmed by reading, not assumed.
// A slot's grouping key — exported so ReportRouteList.jsx's requiredCount/needsRouteSelection
// checks use the exact same grouping this hook resolves against, rather than a second, driftable
// copy of the same fallback rule.

  // deliberate rename — is authoritative and must never be silently overwritten by a resolved
  // route's own name, same as a route's name is authoritative everywhere else in this component
  // (see useReportRow.js's rename-collision guard). Found live 2026-08-04: every row of a
