// AM/PM/Off-Peak Bar Graph Summary, or a Route Compare comparing a peak sub-window against an
// all-day baseline) instead of being forced uniform or silently dropped.

// the PM bar of a Bar Graph Summary, instead of minting two separate route_comp rows the way the
// old tool did to work around not having this). Each entry expands into its OWN output series
// (`labelRouteVariant` above), not just the first one read — `routeIds` itself still lists the
// route once; how many series it becomes is entirely governed by this array's length. No legacy
// scalar fallback — the only pages that matter are the Dynamic Report catalog templates
