// `comp: Comp`, mounted by PluginLayer inside AvlMap's `absolute inset-0
// pointer-events-none` overlay). It therefore owns both the stateful/effectful work AND,

//
//   ControlsPanel   top-left      geography → view → year → measure group

//                                 distribution · legend-with-counts · get-to-a-segment

// ExternalPluginPanel — a fixed 340px box with `w-24` grey labels that cannot express the
// design's 320px shell, white header, grey measure group, segments or chips.
// `externalPanel` now returns [] and the chrome is consumed from the Map component's own
// theme (`damaMap.layerLibrary`) plus `macroview.theme.js`. No core DMS change was needed.

  /**
   * ══ URL STATE ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   *
   * Every viewer control on this map — measure, its dependent controls, year, the
   * geography chips, the worst-25 toggle — round-trips through the URL so a view can be
   * shared, bookmarked and deep-linked (the NPMRDS home page's § 01 rows link straight to
   * `/macro?measure=…`).
   *
   * ⚠ THE PLUGIN NEVER TOUCHES `useSearchParams`. Core's Map component carries the same
   * capability and an explicit warning next to it (ComponentRegistry/map/index.jsx):
   * "writing the URL from the map fights the page's URL ownership and, under React
   * Compiler, ping-pongs into a reload loop." THE PAGE OWNS THE URL. State is read from
   * `pageState.filters` and written through `updatePageStateFilters` — the same producer
   * path click-filters and the map's own share-state use.
   *
   * That means the params must be REGISTERED page variables: `updatePageStateFilters`
   * rebuilds the query string from `pageState.filters.filter(f => f.useSearchParams)` and
   * silently drops any key the page does not declare. Page 2101931 declares the nine keys
   * of the contract in its `filters` array; `registeredUrlKeys()` intersects with them, so
   * the registry IS the opt-in and this plugin on a page with no `filters` simply stops
   * persisting instead of navigating against a URL nobody owns.
   *
   * READ BEFORE WRITE, copied from core's discipline for the measured reason stated there:
   * a remount reseeds defaults (here, `macroview.plugin.jsx`'s `mapRegister` re-runs
   * `updateSubMeasures(filters)` on EVERY mount — and PluginLayer's mount effect runs
   * AFTER this component's, so it lands second), and writing before the read has
   * reconciled would push those defaults over the viewer's selection and bounce
   * navigate↔remount. `urlReadReconciled` is STATE, not a ref, so a remount re-defers;
   * `urlWritePrimedRef` holds the page-synced baseline so the first post-read pass primes
   * instead of writing; and `pageAlreadyHolds` never writes what the page already has.

   * applying once) is what makes that harmless.

  // column_name` and, finding none, resets `filter.values` to the filter's `defaultValue`
  // or `[]`. This plugin's geography filters are keyed on the SOURCE columns (`county`,
  // `mpo_name`, `region_code`, `urban_code`), and the URL contract deliberately does NOT
  // use those names as page variables — a collision would hand our params to that sync —
  // so every one of them resolves to "no page variable" and gets blanked.
