/**
 * The download pill's busy state.
 *
 * There is no React renderer in this repo (no @testing-library, no jsdom), so this cannot assert what
 * the pill renders. What it CAN pin is the two ways the busy state fails silently:
 *
 *   1. a renamed theme key — `className={t.dockPillSpinner}` becomes `className={undefined}` and the
 *      spinner renders as a motionless glyph, no error;
 *   2. an unregistered icon name — the DMS Icon registry resolves by its own key, and a name that is
 *      not in it renders nothing at all. (Carbon's name for an icon is not necessarily the name that
 *      resolves; that mismatch has bitten this codebase before.)
 *
 * Both are the same shape as the five silent defects this download work turned up, so they are worth
 * a test even without the ability to mount the component.
