# EltContext

Modeled after Moleculer [Context](https://moleculer.services/docs/0.14/context.html)

The ETL Context requires a store following the [re-ducks](https://github.com/alexnm/re-ducks) proposal.
For stores following that proposal, it offers a simplified interface for managing state.
Specifically, it is designed to simplify building workflows.
